My sad heart leaks at the poop,
My heart covered in filthy shag:
They squirt it with jets of soup,
My sad heart leaks at the poop:
Under the jibes of that rough troop
Drowned in laughter, see them rag,
My sad heart leaks at the poop,
My heart covered in filthy shag!

Ithyphallic and coarse, their jests
They’ve corrupted it every way!
On the wheelhouse their grotesques,
Ithyphallic and coarse their jests.
O waves, abracadabrantesque,
Take my heart, wash all away!
Ithyphallic and coarse their jests,
They’ve corrupted it every way!

When they’ve finished chewing their plugs,
What shall we do O stolen heart?
Then Bacchic hiccups from ugly mugs:
When they’ve finished chewing their plugs:
My guts will heave, the filthy lugs,
If it’s swallowed outright, my heart:
When they’ve finished chewing their plugs
What shall we do O stolen heart?

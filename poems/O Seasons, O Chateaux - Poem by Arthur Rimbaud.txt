1. (From: Fetes de la Patience)


O seasons, O chateaux,
Where is the flawless soul?

O seasons, O chateaux,

The magic study I pursued,
Of happiness, none can elude.

O may it live, each time
The Gallic cock makes rhyme.

Nothing else I desire,
It’s possessed my life entire.

That charm! It’s taken heart and soul
Scattered all my effort so.

Where’s the sense in what I say?
It makes the whole thing fly away!

O seasons, O chateaux!

O Seasons, O Chateaux

2. (From: Une Saison en Enfer)

O seasons, O chateaux!
Where is the flawless soul?

The magic study I pursued,
Of happiness, none can elude.

A health to it, each time
The Gallic cock makes rhyme.

Ah! There’s nothing I desire,
It’s possessed my life entire.

That charm has taken heart and soul
Scattered all my efforts so.

O seasons, O chateaux!

The hour of its flight, alas!
Will be the hour I pass.

O seasons, O chateaux!

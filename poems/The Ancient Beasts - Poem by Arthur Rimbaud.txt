The ancient beasts bred even on the run,
their glans encrusted with blood and excrement.
Our forefathers displayed their members proudly
by the fold of the sheath and the grain of the scrotum.

In the middle ages, for a female, angel or sow,
a fellow whose gear was substantial was needed;
and even a Kleber, judging by his breeches -
which exaggerate, perhaps, a little -
can't have lacked resources.

Besides, man is equal to the proudest mammal;
we are wrong to be surprised at the hugeness of their members;
but a sterile hour has struck:
the gelding and the ox have bridled their ardours,
and no one will dare again to raise his genital pride
in the copses teeming with comical children.

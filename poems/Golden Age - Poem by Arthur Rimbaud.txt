One of the voices
Always angelic -
It is about me, -
Sharply expresses itself :

Those thousand questions
Spreading their roots Bring in the end,
Only drunkenness and madness ;
Understand this trick

So gay, so easy :
It is only wave, only flower,
And that is your family !
Then it sings.

O So gay, so easy,
And visible to the naked eye... -
I sing with it, -
Understand this trick

So gay, so easy :
It is only wave, only flower,
And that is your family !... etc...
And then a voice -

How angelic it is ! - It is about me,
Sharply expresses itself :
And sings at this moment
Like a sister to breath :
With a German tone,
But ardent and full :
The world is vicious ;
If that surprises you !
Live and leave to the fire
Dark misfortune.

O ! pretty castle !
How bright your life is !
What age do you belong to,
Princely nature Of our elder brother ! etc...

I also sing : Many sisters ! voices
Not at all public ! Surround me
With chaste glory... etc...

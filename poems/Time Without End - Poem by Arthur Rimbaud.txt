We have found it again.
What? Time without end.
'Tis the ocean gone
For a walk with the sun.

Soul, you sentinel,
Murmur and confess,
Day is fiery hell,
Night is nothingness.

From the common urges,
From the human highest
Far thy path diverges:
Following thou fliestâ€¦

No expectancy,
No orietur,
Science patiently;
Punishment is sure.

From your blaze alone,
Satin flames of force,
Duty's breath is blown;
No one says : of course.

We have found it again.
What? Time without end.
'Tis the ocean gone
For a walk with the sun.
